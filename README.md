## By Junta Naito
## Sourcing
I got my data from this data set and focused on the years 2019 to 2022.
## Data Analysis
### 1) In 2022, what rank and happiness score did the countries who had the top 5 highest score for GDP per capita as their explanation for happiness receive? Top 5 lowest? 
1. In "2022" tab, highlight the "Explained by: GDP per capita" column and drag it to the right of the "Happiness score" column.
2. Sort the "Explained by: GDP per capita" column from Z to A, arranging the data in descending order from the highest GDP per capita.

* **As shown, Luxembourg scored the highest for GDP per capita being their explanation for happiness with 2,209, however, ranked #6 among the happiest countries with a happiness score of 7,404. Singapore, coming in second, had a sharper contrast, with a score of 2,149 in their GDP per capita while ranking #27 and a happiness score of 6,480.** 
3. Sort the "Explained by: GDP per capita" column from A to Z, arranging the data in ascending order from the lowest GDP per capita.

### 2) In 2021, what was the averages for the ladder score, GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, and generosity, *by region*? Round decimal to the hundredth place. Which region had the highest average "ladder score"?
1. In the "2021" tab, create a pivot table.
2. In the pivot table, set the row to "Regional indicator."
3. In the column, add "Ladder score", "Logged GDP per capita", "Social support", "Healthy life expectancy", Freedom to make life choices", and "Generosity", and set each "summarize by" to "AVERAGE."
4. Highlight numbers in the data set (B2 to G12) 
5. Under the number formats with the "123" icon, change the format to "number."
