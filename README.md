## Data Analysis
### 1) In 2022, what rank and happiness score did the countries who had the top 5 highest score for GDP per capita as their explanation for happiness receive? Top 5 lowest? 
1. In "2022" tab, highlight the "Explained by: GDP per capita" column and drag it to the right of the "Happiness score" column.
2. Sort the "Explained by: GDP per capita" column from Z to A, arranging the data in descending order from the highest GDP per capita.
